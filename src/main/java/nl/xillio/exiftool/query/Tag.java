/**
 * A {@link Tag} is a value that can be easily extracted from images with
 * an external install of ExifTool.
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * A tag that can be easily parsed to a valid value
 * using the {@link #parse(String)} hint from each {@link Tag}.
 * Using this method allow anyone to convert a string value to the correct
 * data format.
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * Implementations should not make an attempt at converting the value automatically
 * in case the caller decides they would prefer tag values returned in
 * {@link com.thebuzzmedia.exiftool.core.StandardFormat#HUMAN_READABLE} format and
 * to avoid any compatibility issues with future versions of ExifTool if a
 * tag's return value is changed.
 * This approach to leaving returned tag values as strings until
 * the caller decides they want to parse them is a safer and more robust
 * approach.
 *
 * <br>
 *
 * The types provided by each tag are merely a hint based on the
 * <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/index.html">ExifTool Tag Guide</a>
 * by Phil Harvey; the caller is free to parse or process the returned {@link String} values
 * any way they wish.
